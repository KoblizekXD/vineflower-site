Socials
========

Vineflower's social spaces consists of a Discord guild, Matrix room, and IRC channel, all bridged together as one. Before you join, there are some rules to be read:

|
1. No hate speech, bigotry, NSFW content, spam, or otherwise unwanted content.
2. Keep on topic if there is on-topic discussion, and don't import drama from other communities.

|
|

| Another thing to note, multi-line text doesn't bridge to IRC very well and an image or a paste link would be preferred instead.

| IRC: jaskarth.com:6697 #vf-general
|    - TLS encryption is required, and IP addresses are cloaked.
| Matrix: `https://matrix.to/#/#vineflower:dfsek.com <https://matrix.to/#/#vineflower:dfsek.com>`_
